# What Is In This Repo?

In this repo there is an interactive video-clip for the song 
["The Eye of Truth"](https://soundcloud.com/driver-beets/the-eye-of-truth)
by the artist [Driver](https://soundcloud.com/driver-beets).

The project was coded in `Processing` and requires the `Minim` and 
`Processing Video` libraries.

This project was made during the academic year of 2018/2019 in the 
'Programming 3' class of the 'Superior School of Media Arts and Design' in 
Porto. The video-clip was made in collaboration with 'Luisa Lino' who provided
the art and aesthetics.
